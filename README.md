# RASSLE: Reinforcement and Self-Supervised Learning Engine
RASSLE is a C++ library that combines elements of reinforcement learning and self-supervised learning to train agents for various tasks. The library is built with flexibility in mind, allowing users to easily modify and experiment with different algorithms and architectures.

## Features
- Combined reinforcement and self-supervised learning: RASSLE allows you to use both reinforcement learning and self-supervised learning techniques to train your agents.
- Flexible architecture: RASSLE provides a set of interfaces and classes that can be easily extended and modified to suit your needs.
- Easy to use: RASSLE has a simple and well-documented API, making it easy to use even for those new to reinforcement and self-supervised learning.
- Pre-training support: RASSLE allows you to use pre-trained models to initialize your agents, making it easy to leverage existing work and improve sample efficiency.

## Installation
To install RASSLE, clone the repository and build the code using CMake.

  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RASSLE.git
